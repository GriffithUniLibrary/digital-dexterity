### Background

The [Council of Australian University Librarians](https://www.caul.edu.au/) (CAUL) created the [Digital Dexterity project](https://www.caul.edu.au/programs-projects/digital-dexterity-new-skills-learning-and-research-excellence) in 2018, with the aim of helping people develop new skills to boost learning and research excellence.

Digital skills are crucial for people's success not only in education, but also in their daily and working lives. Within the next five years, more than 90 per cent of Australians will use digital skills to perform their work. 

Digital Dexterity encompasses basic digital and information literacies, but also includes ICT proficiency, collaborating digitally with others through virtual meetings and shared documents, and managing an increasingly complex digital identity. Media and data literacy are also part of it. 

By developing local Digital Dexterity support materials, Australian universities and their libraries are helping students and staff acquire the skills and knowledge required to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
